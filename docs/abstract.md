# Abstract

We consider optimal control problems involving nonlinear ordinary differential equations with uncertain inputs. By employing the sample average approximation, we obtain optimal control problems with ensembles of deterministic dynamical systems. Leveraging techniques for metric entropy bounds, we derive non-asymptotic Monte Carlo-type convergence rates for the ensemble-based solutions. Our theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations on an academic optimal control problem and a vaccination scheduling problem for epidemic control under model parameter uncertainty.
